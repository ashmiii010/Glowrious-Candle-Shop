        <h2>My Features</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the features I have acquired over the years</p>
        <li>Body Shape: Pigs have a stout, bulky body with short legs. </li>
            <li>Skin: Their skin is thick and covered with a coat of stiff bristles, which can vary in color among different breeds. </li>
           <li> Snout: They have a long snout with a flat, rounded disk at the end, which they use to root and search for food</li>
            <li>Senses: Pigs have a good sense of smell and hearing, but their eyesight is poor. </li>
            <li>Hooves: Their hooves are cloven, meaning they are split into two. </li>
            <li>Tusks: Wild pigs have sharp tusks used for digging and defense, while domestic pigs have tusklike teeth. </li>
            <li>Size: Domestic pigs can weigh up to 700 pounds, while wild boars are smaller.</li>
